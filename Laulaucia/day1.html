  <ol>
  	<li>I was reminded that spans are for making inline elements and divs are for making block elements</li>
  	<li>I hadn't heard of !important - this seems really good to know</li>
  	<li>It was good to brush up on classes and ids</li>
  	<li><span class = "question">What's a good way to get more CSS practice?</span></li>
