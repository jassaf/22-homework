  <h1>Passion Project</h1>
 <p>
   I'm not sure yet what my passion project should be but I have some ideas.  For one, my boyfriend has to use a really archaic system at work and it would be really neat to build a webapp that could easily input info when he's in the field and then be able to put it in a format that't easily imported into lotus notes. It would save him and his company a lot of time! 

   Something else that would be really cool would be to make some sort of way to connect communities with the social media available around them. it would be interesting to geotag complaints or interesting events or goings on so you could look up an area - not just a business and be able to see the twitter/ map/ instagram activity in that place  in one place

   <li>maybe I dont know how to attack this problem yet but i can figure it out and will know it eventually</li>
   <li>Coding with a goal in mind makes projects better.</li>
