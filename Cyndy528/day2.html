        <h1>Questions I have</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the ideal number of items that each line in array can have? In other words, what is the maximum number of items (words) a line can have?</li>
            <li>I noticed that are multiple ways to write functions. Is there one way preferred over the other?(Examples found in the JavaScript Control Flow.</li>
            <li>If there is the same type of information multiple times in an array, how do we condense the data so that we don't have multiple listings of the same information?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Things I'll use Later</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I will use functions with boolean logic and conditionals in functions.</li>
            <li>I will be using arrays when encountering large amounts of data.</li>
            <li>I really like the effect of looping a video. I will for sure use it!</li>
